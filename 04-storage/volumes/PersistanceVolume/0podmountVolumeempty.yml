#here although pod is in running state we need to go inside the pod and check whether the directory is been created
#for that kubectl exec - it redis-pod -- bash
#in redis we check whether directory is created cd /data/redis/ alos here create an file1 and add some content here
#also restart the Pod for that install some package for redis to restart/ kill the process
#apt-get update
#pt-get install procps
#ps -ef
#kill 1 (PID) 
#once it is restarted check or go inside the pod and check the file and directory is present
#but here the installation of any packages or s/w is been not present once the pods is been restarted
